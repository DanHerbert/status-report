# Status Report Generator

This project consists of 2 different generators:

1. A status report JSON generator, which uses a `config.yaml` file to generate a report about the system health and optionally uploads the JSON to a server using SFTP.
1. A status report HTML generator, which looks for any JSON files generated by that generator and combines all of those in an HTML file.

## Usage

Clone this repo, then create the following files based on the example files provided:

- `/src/config.yaml`
- `/systemd/status-report-html.service.conf`
- `/systemd/status-report-json.service.conf`

After those files are created run

```
make configure
```

Then on systems where the JSON report is generated run:

```
make install-report-json
make enable-report-json
```

On the system where the HTML report is generated, run:

```
make web
make install-report-html
make enable-report-html
```
